I am a postdoctoral researcher in machine learning at Aalto University, Finland, working in [Arno Solin](https://users.aalto.fi/~asolin/)'s group. I received my PhD in Computer Science from Queen Mary University of London in 2019, under the supervision of [Dan Stowell](http://www.mcld.co.uk/) and [Joshua Reiss](http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/~josh/).

My main research interests lie at the intersection of machine learning and signal processing, with a focus on sequential methods for performing inference with Gaussian processes.
