I am a machine learning researcher at [Invenia Labs](https://www.invenia.ca/labs/).

Previously (from 2019-2021), I was a postdoctoral researcher in machine learning at Aalto University, Finland, working in [Arno Solin](https://users.aalto.fi/~asolin/)'s group. I was also a Visiting Turing Fellow at [The Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/), London.

I received my PhD in Computer Science from Queen Mary University of London in 2019, under the supervision of [Dan Stowell](http://www.mcld.co.uk/) and [Joshua Reiss](http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/~josh/).

My main research interests lie at the intersection of machine learning and signal processing, with a focus on statistical inference for spatio-temporal data using Gaussian processes.
